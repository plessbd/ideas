# Drugs

## Ideas

Drug use should be decriminalized.

All drugs should be legally allowed to be purchased.

Make sure side effects are known, and build in tracking for safety.

When you buy drug X, the scientifically "safe" amount is Y doses over Z time, so companies are legally not allowed to sell you more than that.

If you are incapable of doing your job you can still be fired.

If you are driving dangerously, you have your license taken away.

### Stop the "war" on drugs.

Divert money to fund cessation programs.

Other countries illegal cartels can now become legitimate businesses.
