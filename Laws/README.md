# Laws

The point of laws should be to maintain the public safety, not to enforce moral views.

Should be written in language that the average adult can understand (in my opinion 8th grade reading level seems right.)
i.e. [Simplify legal jargon][legal-jargon]

All laws should be [single subject][single-subject].

All laws should be written in ["git"][gitlaw].
Some like [Washington D.C][dc-law] actually are starting to.
This should go further though, the staffers and elected leaders need to be on the commits.
All changes go as pull requests and a simple yes/no on the code change for it to get approved.

18 is generally accepted legal age to do things, so this should still apply to most of the things below unless otherwise specified.

We don't need new laws for things that already exist. i.e. Reckless driving is illegal, there is no need to have DUI to be its own law, it is already covered under reckless driving.
