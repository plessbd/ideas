# Government

## Ideas

The actions of the government should be transparent.

## Law Makers

There should be [term limits][term-limit].

## Contracts

Government contracts should not allow for massive overspending.

If a contract is made to the lowest bidder for $100 then that is all that is paid.
If it cannot be done for that then the payment is forfeit and any work already done
has to be given over to the government.

## Government Funding

If something is government funded it is public domain.

## Laws and Services

Federal Government should define an API that state governments follow.

State Government should define an API that county governments follow.

County Government should define an API that cities/towns/villages follow.

When enough of the lower levels of government have duplicated services / laws
the upper levels should standardize and combine.

## Assistance

### Childcare
If "children are our future", childcare should be paid for by the government.
A person should not have to make the decision of going to work or not based on assistance they get for childcare.

I would rather see free daycare than paid college.

### Unemployment
Unemployment should be able to subsidize a job.
Someone who is unemployed shouldn't turn down a job because it pays less than what they are getting on unemployment.  They should be able to take that job and still get unemployment benefits that will bring them up to the amount of money they would get on unemployment.
